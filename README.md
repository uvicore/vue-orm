# Vue Uvicore API Frontent ORM

## Intro

This is a vue API client for Uvicore specific "autoapi" REST endpoints.

In nearly every way this is actually a frontend ORM (Object Relational Mapping).  All uvicore API's are deeply relational.  Vue models represent the relational data from the backend API.


## Uvicore

Uvicore is an async Python Web, API and CLI full-stack framework.  These uvicore/vue-* libraries help uvicore developers build vue applications.
